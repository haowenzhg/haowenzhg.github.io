## Gender inequality in labor market outcomes
Gender inequality is a multifaceted issue. Addressing gender inequality in the labor market, such as the gender earnings gap and occupational gender segregation, requires understanding mechanisms not only at the workplace, but also in relation to other social institutions, such as the family and educational system. My research draws from demographic frameworks and methods to offer innovative insights into this issue.

<summary> Click for Abstract: What is the relationship between gender segregation in higher education and gender segregation in the labor market? </summary> Using Fossett's (2017) difference-of-means method for calculating segregation indices and data from the American Community Survey, we show that approximately 36% of occupational segregation among college-educated workers is associated with gender segregation across 173 fields of study, and roughly 64% reflects gender segregation within fields. A decomposition analysis shows that fields contribute to occupational segregation mainly through endowment effects (men's and women's uneven distribution across fields) than through the coefficient effects (gender differences in the likelihood of entering a male-dominated occupation from the same field). Endowment effects are highest in fields strongly linked to the labor market, suggesting that educational segregation among fields in which graduates tend to enter a limited set of occupations is particularly consequential for occupational segregation. Within-field occupational segregation is higher among heavily male-dominated fields than other fields, but it does not vary systematically by fields' STEM status or field–occupation linkage strength. Assuming the relationship between field segregation and occupational segregation is at least partly causal, these results imply that integrating higher education (e.g., by increasing women's representation in STEM majors) will reduce but not eliminate gender segregation in labor markets.

## The geography of stratification & spatial mobility
The life chances of individuals and families depend on their geographic location within a country. The other chapters in my dissertation examine the evolving geographic disparities in the distribution of opportunities at the local labor market level, and their implications for spatial mobility across local areas. Another related project examines the geographic distribution of educational opportunities across metropolitan areas and its implications for social mobility.

## Inter- & Intra-generational social mobility 
My third line of research engages with the literature on social mobility, i.e., how individuals move across socioeconomic positions across and within generations. I have examined how various factors shape social hierarchies and lead to structural inequalities between social groups, such as the role of education.

<summary> Click for Abstract: The One Child Policy initiated in the late 1970s created a birth cohort with an unusually high proportion of only children. This paper examines the relationship between being the only child in the family and educational attainment, as well as its potential variations by social origin. </summary> Drawing my sample from the China Family Panel Studies, I compare two birth cohorts born before and after the birth-control policy. Results show that in the younger cohort, being the only child in the family produces a premium in educational outcomes, including years of completed schooling and odds of progressing through critical grade transitions. In addition, I observe a pattern that the only-child premium tends to be larger for people with higher social origins in competitive grade transitions.
