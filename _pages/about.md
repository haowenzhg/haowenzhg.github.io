I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at [Cornell University](https://sociology.cornell.edu/), with a minor in Demography. I obtained a Master's Degree in Applied Quantitative Research from New York University, and a Bachelor's Degree in English and Literature from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

My research focuses on gender, social stratification & mobility, and spatial inequalities. One strand of my research studies how social institutions interact to produce and sustain gender inequality in the labor market, by drawing from demographic frameworks and methods. The second line of my research examines various factors related to social stratification, especially the evolving geographic disparities in the distribution of opportunities across places, and the patterns of spatial and social mobility of individuals and groups across and within generations. I use quantitative and computational methods. 

My [research](/research) has been published in _Demography_ and _Chinese Journal of Sociology_. I received the Kerckhoff Award from the Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility (RC28), the Robin M. Williams, Jr. Best Graduate Student Paper Award from Cornell's sociology department, and the Master's Award for Academic Achievement in the Social Sciences from New York University.
