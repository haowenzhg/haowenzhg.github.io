I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at [Cornell University](https://sociology.cornell.edu/), with a minor in Demography. I obtained a Master's Degree in Applied Quantitative Research from New York University, and a Bachelor's Degree in English and Literature from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

I am a quantitative sociologist with research interests in gender, social stratification & mobility, and spatial demography. I adopt a sociological lens to examine how interactions between social institutions produce and sustain inequality across generational and over the life course. Check out more [details](/research) about the three main lines of my research on gender inequality in labor market outcomes, the geography of stratification & spatial mobility, and inter- and intra-generational social mobility. My research has been published in _Demography_ and _Chinese Journal of Sociology_. I received the Kerckhoff Award from the Research Committee 28 on Social Stratification and Mobility (RC28), the Robin M. Williams, Jr. Best Graduate Student Paper Award from Cornell's sociology department, and the Master's Award for Academic Achievement in the Social Sciences from New York University.
